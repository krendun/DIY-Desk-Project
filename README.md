# DIY Desk Project — Custom Mid-Century Fold-Out Desk

This repository documents the end-to-end design and build of a custom mid-century–inspired wooden desk featuring a left-side fold-out work surface, integrated drawers, a monitor bay with upgrade clearance, and an upper display shelf.

The goal is to maintain **shop-ready documentation** (diagrams + cut list + build binder + journal) so the desk can be built either DIY or by a professional woodworker with minimal ambiguity.
